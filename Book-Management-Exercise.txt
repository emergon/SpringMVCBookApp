Create an application for a librarian. The librarian needs to register books in the library.
The requirements of the application are the following:
Create, Read, Update, Delete books.
Each book has an author. The details of the author that we need are first name, last name, date of birth.
Each book belongs to only one category. The librarian also wants to manage these categories.
The librarian needs a UI to search books based on title or author or category
We also need the title, isbn, price of each book.

Use Spring Framework, Hibernate, JSPs for the application
